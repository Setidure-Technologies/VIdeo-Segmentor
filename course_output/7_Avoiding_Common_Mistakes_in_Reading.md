## Objectives
- Understand the importance of accurate measurement reading.
- Learn to identify the correct reference point for measurements.
- Recognize common mistakes in reading measurements.

## Notes
The images depict a technical drawing with a ruler and a measurement scale. The correct method of reading the measurement is highlighted by changing the label from "NOT here" to "here". 
- The correct reference point is where the object starts, not where it ends.
- The measurement scale is in millimeters (mm).
- Accurate reading is crucial for precise calculations.

## Definitions
- **Measurement Scale**: A scale used to measure the size or length of an object, often marked with units such as millimeters (mm).
- **Reference Point**: The starting point from which a measurement is taken.

## Practical Application
- When using a ruler or measurement scale, ensure to start measuring from the correct reference point.
- Double-check the unit of measurement to avoid errors.
- Accurate measurement reading is critical in various fields such as engineering, construction, and science.
