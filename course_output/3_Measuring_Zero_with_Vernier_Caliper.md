## Objectives
- Understand the parts of a Vernier caliper.
- Learn to read measurements using a Vernier caliper.
- Understand the concept of zero error and its correction.

## Notes
The Vernier caliper is a precision measuring instrument used to measure distances and dimensions.
- Main components: main scale, Vernier scale, jaws.
- The Vernier scale provides additional precision by measuring fractions of the main scale's smallest division.
- To measure zero error, close the jaws and check if the zero marks on both scales align.

## Definitions
- **Vernier Caliper**: A measuring instrument that uses a main scale and a Vernier scale to measure dimensions with high precision.
- **Zero Error**: The error that occurs when the zero marks on the main scale and Vernier scale do not align when the jaws are closed.

## Practical Application
- Measuring the dimensions of objects in engineering, manufacturing, and science.
- Checking the fit and tolerance of parts in assembly.
- Calibrating other measuring instruments.
