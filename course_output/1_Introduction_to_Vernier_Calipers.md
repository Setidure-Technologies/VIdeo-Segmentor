- Identify the main parts of Vernier Calipers.
- Learn the primary function of Vernier Calipers.

## Notes
Vernier Calipers are precision instruments used for measuring dimensions.
- Key components include:
  - Main scale
  - Vernier scale
  - Jaws for measuring internal and external dimensions

## Definitions
- **Vernier Calipers**: A precision instrument used to measure internal and external dimensions of objects with high accuracy.
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on the caliper that provides the main measurement.
- **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, used to measure smaller increments.

## Practical Application
- Used in various fields such as engineering, manufacturing, and science for precise measurements.
- Examples include measuring the diameter of objects, the width of materials, and internal dimensions of cavities.
