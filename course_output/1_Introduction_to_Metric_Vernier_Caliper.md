## Objectives
- Understand the basic components of a Vernier Caliper.
- Learn the primary function of a Vernier Caliper.
- Recognize the importance of precision measurement in various fields.

## Notes
A Vernier Caliper is a precision measuring instrument used to measure distances, widths, and heights with high accuracy. 
- Key components include:
  - Main scale
  - Vernier scale
  - Measuring jaws
- The Vernier scale provides additional precision by allowing for measurements to be taken to a fraction of the main scale's smallest division.

## Definitions
- **Vernier Caliper**: A measuring instrument that uses a Vernier scale to measure distances with high precision.
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on a Vernier Caliper that provides the main measurement.
- **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, used to measure fractions of the main scale's smallest division.

## Practical Application
- Used in various industries such as engineering, manufacturing, and quality control for precise measurements.
- Essential for measuring the dimensions of objects, such as the diameter of a cylinder or the width of a component.
- Enables accurate measurements to be taken quickly and efficiently, improving productivity and reducing errors.
