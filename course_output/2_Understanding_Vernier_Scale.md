## Objectives
* Understand the concept of Vernier calipers
* Learn about the precision of metric Vernier calipers
* Understand how to read measurements using Vernier calipers

## Notes
The video frames explain the use of Vernier calipers, specifically metric Vernier calipers. 
* Vernier calipers are used for precise measurements
* Metric Vernier calipers have a precision of 1/50 mm or 0.02 mm
* The least count of the Vernier scale is calculated as 1/50 = 0.02 mm

## Definitions
* **Vernier Calipers**: A precision measuring instrument used to measure distances or dimensions
* **Metric Vernier Calipers**: A type of Vernier calipers that uses the metric system for measurements
* **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made using a measuring instrument

## Practical Application
Vernier calipers are used in various real-world applications, including:
* Engineering and manufacturing for precise measurements
