## Objectives
* Understand the concept of Metric Vernier Calipers
* Learn to read measurements using Metric Vernier Calipers
* Understand the precision of Metric Vernier Calipers

## Notes
The Metric Vernier Calipers is a precision measuring instrument used to measure distances and widths.
* The main scale is divided into millimeters.
* The vernier scale is used to measure fractions of a millimeter.
* The vernier scale has 50 divisions, making it possible to measure up to 1/50 mm or 0.02 mm.
