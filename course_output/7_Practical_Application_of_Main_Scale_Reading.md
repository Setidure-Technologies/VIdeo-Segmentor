## Objectives
- Understand the concept of main scale reading.
- Learn to identify measurements on a scale.
- Apply main scale reading to practical problems.

## Notes
- The main scale is the primary scale on a measuring instrument.
- It is used to measure the main units of measurement.
- Key concepts:
  - Main scale reading is the primary measurement.
  - Vernier scale or other secondary scales may be used for finer measurements.
  - Accurate reading requires aligning the scale correctly.

## Definitions
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on a measuring instrument used to measure the main units of measurement.
- **Measurement**: The process of determining the size, extent, or degree of something.

## Practical Application
- Engineers use main scale readings to measure components accurately.
- Quality control specialists rely on main scale readings for inspecting products.
- Researchers use main scale readings in experiments requiring precise measurements.
