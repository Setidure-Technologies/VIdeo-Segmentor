## Objectives
- Understand the main scale and vernier scale on a measuring instrument.
- Learn to read measurements using the main scale and vernier scale.
- Understand the concept of least count and its significance.

## Notes
The vernier scale is used in conjunction with the main scale to achieve more precise measurements.
- The main scale provides the primary measurement.
- The vernier scale provides the fractional part of the measurement.
- The least count is the smallest measurement that can be made using the instrument.

## Definitions
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on a measuring instrument that provides the main measurement.
- **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, used to measure fractions of the main scale's smallest division.
- **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made using the instrument, determined by the vernier scale's precision.

## Practical Application
- Used in precision engineering and scientific instruments for accurate measurements.
- Examples include vernier calipers, micrometers, and other precision measuring tools.
- Essential in various fields such as mechanical engineering, physics, and quality control.
