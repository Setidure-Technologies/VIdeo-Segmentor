## Objectives
- Understand the concept of measurement surfaces and gaps.
- Learn to identify measurement surfaces and gaps in technical drawings.
- Recognize the importance of accurate measurement in engineering and manufacturing.

## Notes
- The diagrams illustrate the use of calipers for precise measurement.
- Key concepts include:
  • Understanding the main scale and vernier scale.
  • Identifying the measurement surfaces (jaws) of the caliper.
  • Recognizing the gap between the measurement surfaces.

## Definitions
- **Measurement Surface**: The surface of a measuring instrument that comes into contact with the object being measured.
- **Gap**: The distance between the measurement surfaces of a measuring instrument.

## Practical Application
- Calipers are used in various industries, including manufacturing, engineering, and quality control, to measure dimensions accurately.
- Accurate measurement is crucial for ensuring the quality and functionality of parts and assemblies.
- Understanding measurement surfaces and gaps is essential for interpreting technical drawings and specifications.
