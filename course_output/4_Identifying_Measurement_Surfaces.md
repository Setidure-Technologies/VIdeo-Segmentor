## Objectives
- Understand the importance of identifying measurement surfaces.
- Learn to accurately read measurements using a vernier scale.
- Recognize the correct surfaces for measurement on a part.

## Notes
- The vernier scale is used for precise measurements.
- Measurement surfaces are critical for accurate readings.
  - The main scale provides the primary measurement.
  - The vernier scale provides the secondary, more precise measurement.

## Definitions
- **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale used in conjunction with a main scale to provide more precise measurements.
- **Measurement Surfaces**: The surfaces on a part or object that are used as reference points for taking measurements.

## Practical Application
- Engineers and technicians use vernier calipers to measure the dimensions of parts in manufacturing and quality control.
- Accurate identification of measurement surfaces is crucial in ensuring that parts meet specifications and tolerances.
