# Vernier Calipers Diagram
## Module Title & Learning Objectives
In this module, students will learn about the components and functionality of Vernier calipers, a precision measuring instrument used to measure distances and dimensions. By the end of this module, students will be able to:
* Identify the main parts of Vernier calipers
* Understand how to read measurements using Vernier calipers
* Apply Vernier calipers in real-world scenarios

## Deep Dive Lecture Notes
The provided diagrams illustrate the key components and usage of Vernier calipers. Here are the key points to note:
* **Main Parts**:
	+ **Main Scale**: The fixed scale on the caliper that provides the primary measurement.
	+ **Vernier Scale**: The sliding scale that provides the secondary measurement, allowing for more precise readings.
	+ **Jaws**: The movable parts that come into contact with the object being measured.
* **Measurement Reading**:
	+ The main scale reading is taken from the main scale.
	+ The Vernier scale reading is taken from the Vernier scale, where it aligns with the main scale.
	+ The final measurement is the sum of the main scale and Vernier scale readings.
* **Key Features**:
	+ **Precision**: Vernier calipers offer high precision measurements, typically to 0.01 mm or 0.001 inches.
	+ **Range**: The range of measurement depends on the specific caliper, but typically spans several centimeters or inches.

## Key Terminology
* **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, allowing for more precise measurements.
* **Main Scale**: The primary scale on the caliper that provides the initial measurement.
* **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made using the Vernier calipers, typically 0.01 mm or 0.001 inches.

## Practical Application
Vernier calipers are widely used in various industries, including:
* **Engineering**: For precise measurements of parts and components.
* **Quality Control**: To ensure accurate dimensions and tolerances.
* **Scientific Research**: To measure small distances and dimensions in experiments.
