## Objectives
- Understand how to read a main scale on a measuring instrument.
- Identify the correct reading on a scale.
- Recognize the importance of aligning the measurement with the correct scale.

## Notes
- The main scale is the primary scale on a measuring instrument, used to measure the main units of measurement.
- Key concepts:
  * The main scale is usually the larger scale on the measuring instrument.
  * Readings are taken directly from the main scale.
  * Alignment is crucial for accurate measurement.

## Definitions
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on a measuring instrument that measures the main units of measurement.
- **Measurement Alignment**: The process of ensuring that the object being measured is properly aligned with the scale to obtain an accurate reading.

## Practical Application
- Engineers and technicians use main scales to measure dimensions and distances in various projects, such as construction, manufacturing, and quality control.
- Accurate reading of the main scale is critical in ensuring that measurements are precise and reliable.
