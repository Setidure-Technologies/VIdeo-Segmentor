## Objectives
- Understand the importance of calibrating a Vernier caliper to zero.
- Learn the steps to calibrate a Vernier caliper.
- Recognize the components involved in the calibration process.

## Notes
The Vernier caliper is a precision instrument used for measuring dimensions. Calibrating it to zero ensures accurate measurements.
- The main scale and Vernier scale are the key components.
- The zero error is adjusted by aligning the zero marks on both scales.
- The screw or adjustment mechanism is used to calibrate the caliper.

## Definitions
- **Vernier Caliper**: A precision measuring instrument that uses a Vernier scale to measure dimensions accurately.
- **Zero Error**: The error that occurs when the zero marks on the main scale and Vernier scale are not aligned.
- **Calibration**: The process of adjusting an instrument to ensure its accuracy.

## Practical Application
- Calibrating a Vernier caliper is crucial in various industries such as engineering, manufacturing, and quality control.
- Accurate measurements are essential for ensuring the quality and precision of products.
- Regular calibration of measuring instruments like Vernier calipers is necessary to maintain their accuracy over time.
