# Understanding the Main Scale and Vernier Scale
## Module Title & Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:
* Understand the concept of Main Scale and Vernier Scale
* Identify and explain the purpose of each scale
* Learn how to read measurements using both scales
* Apply the knowledge in real-life scenarios

## Deep Dive Lecture Notes
The provided diagrams illustrate the working of a Vernier Caliper, a precision measuring instrument. The key components are:
* **Main Scale**: The primary scale that provides the main measurement.
	+ Divided into units (e.g., millimeters or inches)
	+ Provides the coarse measurement
* **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the Main Scale.
	+ Divided into smaller units that match the Main Scale's units
	+ Provides the fine measurement

To read the measurement:
1. **Read the Main Scale**: Note the value on the Main Scale that is just below the zero mark on the Vernier Scale.
2. **Read the Vernier Scale**: Identify the line on the Vernier Scale that aligns with a line on the Main Scale. The value on the Vernier Scale at this alignment is the fine measurement.
3. **Combine the Readings**: Add the Main Scale reading and the Vernier Scale reading to obtain the final measurement.

## Key Terminology
* **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made using the Vernier Caliper.
* **Precision**: The degree of accuracy with which a measurement is made.

## Practical Application
The Vernier Caliper is used in various fields, such as:
* **Engineering**: For precise measurements of components and assemblies.
* **Quality Control**: To ensure that manufactured parts meet specifications.
* **Scientific Research**: For accurate measurements in experiments and data collection.
