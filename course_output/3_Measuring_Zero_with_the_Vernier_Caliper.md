## Objectives
- Understand the concept of measuring zero with a Vernier caliper.
- Learn to accurately read measurements using a Vernier caliper.
- Identify the importance of calibration in measurement.

## Notes
The Vernier caliper is a precision instrument used to measure distances and dimensions. 
- It consists of a main scale and a Vernier scale.
- The Vernier scale provides additional precision by allowing for measurements to be taken to a fraction of the main scale's smallest division.
- To measure zero, the caliper's jaws are closed, and the reading is taken.

## Definitions
- **Vernier Caliper**: A precision measuring instrument that uses a Vernier scale to provide accurate measurements.
- **Main Scale**: The primary scale on the caliper that provides the main measurement.
- **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, used to measure fractions of the main scale's smallest division.

## Practical Application
- Engineers use Vernier calipers to measure the dimensions of parts and components.
- Quality control specialists rely on Vernier calipers to verify the accuracy of manufactured parts.
- Researchers use Vernier calipers in various scientific experiments requiring precise measurements.
