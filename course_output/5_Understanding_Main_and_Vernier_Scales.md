## Objectives
- Understand the concept of main and vernier scales.
- Learn to read measurements using vernier scales.
- Identify the precision of vernier scales.

## Notes
The vernier scale is used to measure small distances with high precision. It works by having two scales: a main scale and a vernier scale.
* The main scale provides the primary measurement.
* The vernier scale provides the fractional part of the measurement.
* The vernier scale's precision is determined by its least count.

## Definitions
* **Main Scale**: The primary scale used for measurement, usually marked with major units.
* **Vernier Scale**: A secondary scale that slides along the main scale, used to measure fractions of the main scale's units.
* **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made with a vernier scale, determined by the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

## Practical Application
Vernier scales are used in various precision instruments such as calipers, micrometers, and spectrometers. They are essential in engineering, physics, and other fields where accurate measurements are crucial. Examples include measuring the diameter of small objects, the thickness of materials, and the wavelength of light.
