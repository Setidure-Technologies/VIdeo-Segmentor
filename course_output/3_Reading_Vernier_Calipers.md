**Module Title & Learning Objectives**
=====================================

**Reading Vernier Calipers**
---------------------------

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Understand the basic components and features of a Vernier caliper
* Learn to read measurements using the Vernier scale
* Apply Vernier caliper readings in real-world applications

**Deep Dive Lecture Notes**
-------------------------

The following key concepts are discussed in this segment:

* **Vernier Caliper Resolution**: The Vernier caliper has a resolution of **1/50 mm** or **0.02 mm**.
* **Vernier Scale**: The Vernier scale is a secondary scale that slides along the main scale, allowing for more precise measurements.
* **Least Count**: The least count of the Vernier caliper is **0.02 mm**, which means it can measure lengths with an accuracy of ±0.02 mm.

Some key features of the Vernier caliper include:

* **Main Scale**: The main scale is divided into millimeters, with each major division representing 1 mm.
* **Vernier Scale**: The Vernier scale has 50 divisions, with each division representing 0.02 mm.

**Key Terminology**
-------------------

* **Vernier Caliper**: A precision measuring instrument used to measure lengths and widths of objects.
* **Least Count**: The smallest measurement that can be made with a measuring instrument.
* **Resolution**: The smallest difference between two measurements that can be distinguished by an instrument.

**Practical Application**
----------------------

Vernier calipers are widely used in various fields, including:

* **Engineering**: Vernier calipers are used to measure the dimensions of parts and components.
* **Quality Control**: Vernier calipers are used to inspect the dimensions of products and ensure they meet specifications.
* **Scientific Research**: Vernier calipers are used to measure the dimensions of samples and specimens.
